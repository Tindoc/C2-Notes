# Attention
Because I uesd this Chinese Edition book and I'm a poor English learner, so used  Chinese to <b>Comment</b> .c file, if you computer didn't install Chinese Font, you may see many random code in the comment, please feel free.<br />
I think <i>Code without bodrders</i>, so this problem can't trouble you.
Maybe I will used bilingual in Comment or try my best to no comment.

# More and more importance
Just coding the Exercises and Programming Projects by your hand on your computer, keep think, try and correct it.<br />
I suggest you don't see the answers if you don't run your projects third times at least.
